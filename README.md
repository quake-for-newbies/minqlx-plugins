# Quake For Newbies minqlx plugins

[Minqlx](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx) plugins used on the Quake For Newbies Quake Live servers.

* `antihoag.py`, by rinrekku - when a player reaches a max winstreak of 3, they get moved to spectators.
* `disable_ca.py`, by burtically - disable votemap to the clan arena game mode.
* `twitch.py`, by tumer - a light fork of [irc.py](https://github.com/MinoMino/minqlx-plugins/blob/master/irc.py), bridges twitch chat and quake live chat. Twitch chat receives all chat, while in game only spectators receive twitch chat messages.
